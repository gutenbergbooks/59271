<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Scene.</span>—<i>Monday at the Allen’s.—Mrs. Allen kneading bread.
Tirzah Ann washing at the washtub.—Widder Doodle picking
over beans.—Elder Peedick sitting in the corner arranging a
book of manuscript sermons.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Oh how much these beans makes me think of
Doodle. He died, Doodle did, and was a corpse just as quick
as he died; but I never can forget that dear man, nor his linement
never. And it hain’t no ways likely that I shall ever
marry agin’.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Cheer up, Widder Doodle, cheer up. You’ll disturb
the Elder, and he wants to get his sermons all pinned together
before he starts; and Josiah is out after the horse now. I am
glad you stayed over Sunday with us Elder.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> I thank you, Madam. (<i>He goes on with his work, speaking
to himself</i>): Let me see, where is the 20thly?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Could you forget your Josiah, if you lived to be his
relict?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No; I loved Josiah Allen, though why I loved
him, I know not. But in the immortal words of the
poet, “Love will go where it is sent.” Yes, Tirzah Ann,
I married your pa in mother’s parlor, on the 14th day of
June, in a brown silk dress with a long boddist waist, from
pure love. And that love has been like a beacon in our pathway
ever since. Its pure light, though it has sputtered some,
and in trying times, such as washing days and cleaning house,
has burnt down pretty low—has never gone out. Tirzah
Ann, look at your father’s wristbands and collar, and see if
you can see any streaks of white on ’em. Now Tirzah Ann,
you are inclined to be sentimental. You took it from your pa.
Josiah Allen, if he was encouraged, would act spoony. I remember
when we were first engaged he called me a little angel.
I just looked at him and says I, I weigh 204 pounds by
the stillyards; and he didn’t call me so agin. I guess he tho’t
204 pounds would make a pretty hefty angel. No, Tirzah Ann,
sentiment hain’t my style; reason and common sense are my
themes. Now there is Betsey Bobbett: she is one of the sentimentolest
creeters that ever I did see. She is awful opposed
to women’s rights. She says it looks so sweet and genteel,
somehow, for wimmin to not have any rights. She says it is
wimmen’s only spear to marry. But as yet she hain’t found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>any man willin’ to lay hold of that spear with her. But she is
always a talking about how sweet it is for wimmin to be like
runnin’ vines, a clingin’ to man like ivy to a tree.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> (<i>in a stately way</i>) Them are my sentiments, Mrs.
Allen. As I remarked yesterday in my tenthly, “Marriage is
wimmen’s only spear.” And as I remarked in my fourteenthly,
“How sweet, how heavenly the sight, to see a lovely woman
clinging like a sweet, twining, creeping vine to a man’s manly
strength.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> It is pretty to see it; I love to cling; I used to
cling to Doodle.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> I wish I had known Doodle; he must have been a
happy man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> But, Elder, how is a woman to cling if she hain’t nothin’
to cling to. What are the wimmen to do whose faces are as
humbly as a plate of cold greens? Is such a woman to go out
into the street and collar a man and order him to marry her?
Now I say a woman hadn’t ort to marry unless she has a man
to marry to—a man whose love satisfies her head and her heart;
some men’s love hain’t worth nothin’. I wouldn’t give a cent
a bushel for it by the car load. But I mean a man that suits
her; a man she seems to belong to, just like North and South
America jined by nater, unbeknown to them ever since creation.
She’ll know him if she ever sees him, jest as I knew my Josiah,
for their two hearts will suit each other jest like the two halves
of a pair of shears. These are the marriages heaven signs the
certificuts of; and this marryin’ for a home, or for fear of bein’
called a old maid is no more marriage in the sight of God, no
more true marriage than the blush of a fashionable woman that
is bought for ten cents an ounce and carried home in her
pocket, is true modesty.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> I can only repeat what I said yesterday in my 21stly.
That it is flyin’ in the face of the Bible for a woman not to
marry. It is heaven’s design that women should be a vine, and
man a tree.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> I always thought my Doodle was a tree. I knew
he was.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Well Elder, your wife is jest dead with the tyfus, and
I ask you this queston. Are you willing to let Betsey Bobbett
cling to you?  She believes jest as you do, and she is fairly dying
to make a runnin’ vine of herself; and are you willing to
be a tree?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> Wall—as it were—Mrs. Allen—I—that is—the religious
state of the country at present is—as it were—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Are you willing to be a tree?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> I believe Mrs. Allen you are a strong Grant woman.
Now I favor Blaine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Are you willing to be a tree?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Elder.</span> I guess I’ll go to the barn and get my saddle bags.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Exit</i> <span class='sc'>Elder</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I knew jest how it would be; I knew he wouldn’t be a
tree.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> Wall; I don’t blame him mother. You ought to
have seen Betsey last night to meetin’. She got up to
talk, and she would look right at Elder Peedick, and then at
the editor of the <i>Augur</i>, and at Simon Slimpsey, and says she:
I know I am religious because I feel that I love the bretheren.
I don’t blame him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No, nor I nuther. I don’t want a man to be a tree,
unless they want to, and I want them to use reason and not
insist on every woman makin’ a vine of herself. But the Elder
means middlin’ well, and he’d make a tolerable good husband
for some woman.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> It haint no ways likely I shall ever marry again.
No other man’s linement can ever look to me like my Doodle’s
linement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> But the Elder has belated us dreadfully with our Monday’s
work. Here it is most night and we have only fairly got
to work. But we can finish it in the morning. Yes, as I was
a saying Tirzah Ann, Betsey hain’t handsome, her cheek bones
are too high, and she, being not much more than skin and
bone, they show more than if she was in good order. Time
has seen fit to deprive her of her hair and teeth, but her large
nose he has kindly suffered her to keep. I have seen a good
many that was sentimental that had it bad; but Betsey has got
it the worst of anybody I ever did see, unless it is her brother
Shakespeare, and he acts as spoony round you, Tirzah Ann, as
any spoon on my buttery shelves. It worrys me.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid D.</span> My Doodle used to act spoony, as spoony as—as a
teaspoon.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall if I thought there was any danger, Tirzah Ann, of
you falling in love with Shakespeare Bobbett, I’d give you a
good thoroughwort puke. That will cure most anybody if you
take it in time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> Wall, I guess there hain’t no chance, mother.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, mabby not. Now you wring the clothes out,
Tirzah Ann, and hang ’em right up here on the line.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> They will look awfully, mother, hangin’ up here.
We shall look as if we was settin’ in a wet calico tent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I don’t care, Tirzah Ann, we are so beat out we shall
go to bed as soon as it is dark.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> We shall have to any way, for father forgot to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the kerosine can, and there hain’t a lamp in the house that we
can light. But oh, dear, how it does look here, mother. I
never in my hull life see our house look as it does to-night. It
would mortify me most to death if any body should come in.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, there hain’t no danger of anybody comin’ Monday;
and we will slick up the first thing in the morning. But
bein’ up all night with Thomas Jefferson, and then havin’ to
wait on the Elder, and doin’ our Monday’s work in the atternoon,
has about used me up, and if you think you can finish up
Tirzah Ann, I will soak my feet and go to bed. I am afraid I
am goin’ to be awful sick. I feel sick to my stomach all of a
sudden, and every bit of noise goes through my head like a
sword.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Let me get you some warm water, Samantha.
Here, put your feet right into it; and here, put your night-cap
on. Oh dear me, how much that sickness to the stomach makes
me think of Doodle. Do you feel better, Samantha?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I shan’t feel any better till I get to bed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Josiah</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> Why, what is the matter father?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Josiah</span> (<i>groaning</i>). Oh! I have been took with a dumb creek
in my back. Give me some of that linement quick, and rub it
onto my shoulders, Tirzah Ann. What is the matter with your
mother? Is she sick?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Oh yes; Samantha is awful sick—took sudden—and
there is Thomas J. up stairs sick abed. If there was ever a
distressed house, this is the house.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> It looks distressed, anyway.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Josiah, won’t you try some of the Green Mounting
salve?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Josiah.</span> Oh! I don’t know; I can’t set down, or stand up;
I am awful bad off. I want to get to bed as soon as I can.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Try the Green Mounting salve, brother Josiah; and
oh how much that salve makes me think——(<i>looking out the window</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> Why, for mercy’s sake! Who is coming? There
is a whole house-full of folks on the door-step. (<i>Tirzah Ann
and the Widder Doodle runs out of the room, as the door opens, and ten
or fifteen people come in, headed by Betsey Bobbett. Josiah tries to fix
his shirt and vest round his shoulders before they get in but he can’t, so
he dives under the table. Samantha stands her ground. She stands up

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Betsey B.</span> We have come to surprise you! And in order to
more sweetly surprise you, we have come Monday night, and
come early. Will you not let us surprise you?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No! no! We will not be surprised! You shan’t surprise
us to-night! We won’t be surprised! Speak, Josiah;
tell her; will we be surprised to-night?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Josiah.</span> (<i>Looking out from under the table spread</i>) No; No; we
will not be surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet. B.</span> You see dear friends she will not let us surprise her;
we will go. (<i>They all go out. Betsey goes last, and she turns around
at the door and says</i>) Maybe it is right and propah to serve a
young girl, who has always been your friend, in this way. I
have known you a long time Josiah Allen’s wife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> (<i>Stepping out of the foot bath and shutting up the door</i>) I have
known you plenty long enough.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Josiah.</span> (<i>Coming out from under the table</i>) Darn surprise parties,
and darn——</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Stop swearin’, Josiah Allen; I should think we was
bad enough off without swearing. But I hate surprise parties
as bad as you do. Betsey Bobbett has led ’em into one
house where they had the small-pox, and one where they was
makin’ preparations for a funeral. They are perfect nusances.
It stands to reason so long as anybody has got a tongue, if they
want to see their friends to their house, they can invite ’em,
and if anybody is too poor to bake a cake or two, and a pan of
cookies, they are too poor to go into company at all. I hain’t
proud, and never was called so, but I don’t want Tom, Dick,
and Harry, that I never spoke to in my life, feel free to break
into my house any time they please. I perfectly detest surprise
parties; but you don’t ketch me swearin’ about it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Wall; I <i>will</i> say darn Betsey Bobbett; there now, <i>darn
her</i>; oh! my back; (<i>slowly sitting down</i>) I can’t sit down, nor
stand down.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> You went under the table quick enough when they
come in.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Throw that in my face, will you? What could I do?
My clothes all fallin’ of me.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, Josiah, less be thankful that we are as well off as
we be. Betsey might have insisted on surprisin’ us. Do you
s’pose they will be mad?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> I don’t know, nor care, but I hope they will.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I declare them hens makes me more trouble than all
the rest of my work, keeps me a scarin’ ’em out of the garden
all the time, and that pup hain’t good for anything.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> Father says all it wants is a little encouragement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Encouragement! I should think as much. Yes I know
your pa says that if he will run a little ahead of it when he is a
settin’ it on to things, it will go on to one first rate. And I
told him he had better take the pup in his arms and throw it at
the hens mebby that would encourage it enough. But there
they are; I must go and scare ’em off again.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> I’ll go mother. (<i>She goes out clapping her hands and
crying “Shoo; Shoo;” and the hens are heard cackling behind the scenes.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Oh how much that pup makes me think of Doodle.
My Doodle needed encouragement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> (<i>Coming back</i>) Here comes Betsey Bobbett, mother.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Betsey</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>All Say.</span> Good morning, Betsey.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> (<i>Sadly</i>) Good morning, Miss Allen; good morning, Tirzah
Ann; good morning, Widder Doodle. (<i>She sits down and
takes out her tatting and commences to work</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Hain’t you well to-day, Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I feel deprested to-day; awfully deprested.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> What is the matter?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I feel lonely; more lonely than I have felt for yeahs.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> What is the matter, Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I had a dream last night, Josiah Allen’s wife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> What was it?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I dreamed I was married, Josiah Allen’s wife. I tell
you it was hard, after dreamin’ that, to wake up to the cold
realities and cares of this life; it was <i>hard</i>. I sot up in end of
the bed and wept. (<i>she weeps</i>) I tried to get to sleep again and
dream it ovah, but I could not.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, to be sure, husbands are handy on 4th of Julys,
and funeral processions. It looks kinder lonesome to see a woman
streaming along alone; but they are contrary creeters,
Betsey, when they are a mind to be. How do you like my new
bed-spread?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> It is beautiful.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Yes; it looks well enough now, but it most wore my
fingers out a tuftin’ it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> How sweet it must be to wear the fingers out for a
deah companion. I would be willing to wear mine clear down
to the bone. I made a vow, some yeahs ago, that I would
make my deah future companion happy, for I would nevah,
nevah fail to meet him with a sweet smile as he came home to
me at twilight. I felt that was all he would require to make
him happy. Do you think it was a rash vow, Josiah Allen’s
wife?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Oh, I guess it won’t do any hurt. But if a man couldn’t
have but one of the two, a smile or a supper, as he came home
at night, I believe he would take the supper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> I know Doodle would. He had to have jest what
he wanted to eat at jest the time he wanted it, or it would give
him the palsy; he never had the palsy, but he always said that
all that kept him from it was havin’ meat vittles, or anything
else he wanted, jest the minute he wanted it. Oh, what a man
that was; what a linement he had on him. It hain’t no ways
likely I shall ever marry agin. No, I shan’t never see another
man whose linement will look to me like Mr. Doodlese’s linement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Yes, Betsey, I believe a man would take the supper instead
of the smile.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh, deah! such cold practical ideahs are painful to me.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, if you ever have the opportunity you try both
ways; let your fire go out and you and your house look like
fury, and nothing to eat, and you jest stand in the door and
smile. And then again you have a nice supper—stewed oysters
and cream biscuit and peaches, or something else first rate,
and the table all set out as nice as a pink, and the kettle singing,
and you dressed up pretty, and goin’ round the house in a
sensible way, and you jest watch and see which of the two
ways is the most agreeable to him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh, food! food! what is food to the deathless emotions
of the soul? What does the aching young heart care what food
it eats? Let my dear futuah companion smile on me, and that
is enough.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> A man can’t smile on an empty stomach, Betsey. And
a man can’t eat soggy bread with little chunks of saleratus in
it, and clammy potatoes, and drink dish-water tea and muddy
coffee and smile; or they might give one or two sickly, deathly
smiles; but depend upon it, Betsey, they couldn’t keep it up.
I have seen bread, Betsey Bobbett, that was enough to break
down any man’s affection, unless he had firm principle to back
it up, and love’s young dream has been drounded in thick muddy
coffee before now. If there hain’t anything pleasant in a
man’s home how can he be attached to it? Nobody can’t, man
nor women, respect what hain’t respectable, nor love what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>hain’t lovable. Of course men have to be corrected sometimes.
I correct Josiah frequently.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> How any one blessed with a deah companion can speak
about correcting them, is a mystery to me.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Men have to be corrected, Betsey; there wouldn’t be no
living with them unless you did.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Well, you can entertain such views if you will, but as
for me, I will be clinging; I will be respected by men. They
do so love to have wimmen clinging, that I will, until I die,
carry out this belief that is so sweet to them. Until I die, I
will neveh let go of this speah.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> There is a gentleman coming.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Young lady, can’t I sell you this beautiful lace neck-tie;
real old point lace, and only 18 pence.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tirz. A.</span> Oh, mother, do buy it for me.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No, Tirzah Ann, no.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Then let me sell you this beautiful valuable ring. Most
diamond dealers would want to make a profit of a hundred dollars
or so on it, but I will let you have it for five shillings. It
weighs over a hundred and 4 carets.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> A hundred and 4 carrots; that is a likely story. Why,
if the carrots was any size at all that would be over a bushel.
<i>No</i>, Tirzah Ann, you can’t have the ring.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Can’t I sell you something, madam.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Oh, no, I am a widder; and it hain’t no ways likely
I shall ever marry agin. (<i>She weeps, wipes her eyes on her apron</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Here, I have got just what you want and need. See
this beautiful mourning handkerchief. It is almost worth the
agony of bein’ a widder to enjoy the privilege of mournin’ on
such a handkerchief as that. It is richly worth 75 cents, but
you may have it for 25, and what will you give?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> I will give a quarter of a dollar.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Take it at your own price. Now Madam (<i>turning to
Samantha</i>). Let me sell you this beautiful carpet; it is the pure
ingrain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Ingrain; so be you ingrain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> I guess I know, for I bought it of old Ingrain himself.
I give the old man 12 shillings a yard for it; but seeing it is
you, and I like your looks so much, and it seems so much like
home to me here, I will let you have it for 75 cents a yard;
cheaper than dirt to walk on, or boards.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I don’t want it; I have got carpets enough.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Do you want it for 50 cents?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Would 25 cents be any inducement to you?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Would 18 cents tempt you?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Say another word to me about your old stair carpet if
you dare; jest let me ketch you at it. Be I going to have you
a trapsin’ all over the house after me? Am I going to be made
crazy as a loon by you?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh, Josiah Allen’s wife, do not be so hasty; of course
the gentleman wishes to dispose of his goods, else why should
he be in the mercanteel business?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> (<i>Turning to Betsey, takes ear-rings out of his pocket</i>) I carry
these in my pocket for fear I will be robbed. I hadn’t ought
to carry them round at all; a single man going alone around the
country as I do; but I have got a pistol. (<i>he takes a large pistol,
the larger the better, from his pocket. Betsey shrieks and falls back
terribly frightened</i>) I have got a pistol, and let anybody tackle
me for these ear-rings if they dare to.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Is their intrinsic worth so much?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> It hain’t so much their neat value, although that is
enormous, as who owned them informally. Whose ears do
you suppose these have had hold of?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> How can I tell, never having seen them before.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Jest so. You never was acquainted with them, but
these very identical creeters used to belong to Miss Shakespeare.
Yes, these belonged to Hamlet’s mother. Bill bought
’em at old Stratford.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Bill?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Yes, old Shakespeare. I have been with his family so
much, that I have got into the habit of calling him Bill, jest as
they do.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Then you have been there?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Oh, yes; I wintered there and partly summered. But
as I was a saying, Bill give ’em to his wife; he give ’em to Ann
when he first begun to pay attention to her. Bill bought ’em
of a one-eyed man with a wooden leg by the name of Brown.
Miss Shakespeare wore ’em as long as she lived, and they was
kept in the family till I bought ’em; a sister of one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>brother-in-law’s was obliged to part with ’em to get morphine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I suppose you ask a large price for them?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> How much! how much you remind me of a favorite
sister who died when she was fifteen. She was considered by
good judges to be the handsomest girl in North America. But
business before pleasure—I ought to have upwards of 30 dollars
a head for ’em; but seeing it is you, and it hain’t no ways likely
that I shall ever meet with another wo——young girl that I
feel under bonds to sell ’em to, you may have ’em for 13 dollars
and a half.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> That is more money than I thought of spending to-day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Let me tell you what I will do. I don’t care seeing it’s
you, if I do get cheated. I am willing to be cheated by one
that looks so much like that angel sister. Give me 13 dollars
and a half and I’ll throw in the pin that goes with ’em. I
did want to keep that to remind me of them happy days at
Stratford. But take ’em, take ’em and put ’em out of my
sight right quick, or I shall repent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> (<i>tenderly</i>) I don’t want to rob you of them, deah man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ped.</span> Take ’em, and give me the money quick, before I am
completely unmanned. (<i>takes money</i>) Take care of the ear-rings,
and Heaven bless you.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Why that was the newraligy the doctor said.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> Doctors are liable to mistakes. I always thought it
was the tizick. There are more folks that are tizicky in this
world than you think for. I am a master hand for knowing
tizick when I see it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> It looks more to me like the very oh lord.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Dr. B.</span> No; you can’t fool me on diseases; I have never had
my dognoses disputed. The other Dr. in Jonesville was called
in the other day to a plain case of ganders; he called it gallopin’
consumption. The minute I sot my eyes on the man I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>said ganders. And this is a clear case of zebra smilen marcellus.
Good landlord, you can’t fool me on the zebra.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> That is a disease I never made no calculations on havin’.
Where does the zebra generally tackle folks?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Dr. B.</span> Wall, people generally have it in the posterity part of

only keep it in the foot, keep it from the brain, I can help you.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Scene.</span>—<i>Samantha’s kitchen, with a great deal of work about.—Enter
Editor of the Augur leading a twin by each hand.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ed.</span> My hired girl has left me, Mrs. Allen, and I want to go
to Shackeville this morning and see if I can find one. And I
called to see if I could leave a twin or two with you while I am
gone. And Mr. Allen invited me to come back to dinner; I
told him I would, and I would read to you a political argument
I have written for the next week’s <i>Augur</i>. It is as long as the
President’s message, and is in blank verse. (<i>Samantha groans</i>)
Mr. Allen told me that the Widder Doodle and Tirzah Ann
had gone a visiting, and you had sights of work to do. I
hated to ask you to take care of the twins; but I really didn’t
know what to do; I was at my wit’s end.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Probable, there has been longer journeys took than
that was; but I will keep the twins. I will try to do just as
my friend John Rogers would have done.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ed.</span> Who?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> The first martyr in Queen Mary’s reign. Here children
let me take off your things. But I have got sights and
sights of work to do to-day, and I have got to go up into the
wood-house chamber to do some work, and you will have to
stay here with the twins till I come back. Here is a picture
book they may take to recreate on while I am gone. It is
Foxe’s book of martyrs; and oh what a comfort that book is to
me on days like this. Anybody may say they are patient and
unselfish, and are willing to be martyrs; but I tell you you
can’t tell what principles folks are made of till they are sot fire
to. Now the religion and self-denial and sound principles of
them old martyrs of Foxes, they couldn’t burn up, they couldn’t
make a fire hot enough. And when I am tied to different
stakes of martyrdom, I tell you it keeps my mind cool and
calm, to think of the patience of them old martyrs of Foxes,
and compare my sufferin’s with thiern, and meditate on this fact,
that fire hain’t no hotter now than it was then, and though the
soul may boy the body up triumphant, there couldn’t be any
body burnt up without smartin’. Yes, I will keep the twins,
and I will hear your blank verses; I will be down shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I saw you coming in here and I hurried over to bring
some poetry that I have been composing for your paper. It is
called “Gushings of a Tender Soul.” And would it be any
more soothing and comforting to you if I should sign my name
Bettie Bobbett, or Betsey as I always have? I asked Josiah
Allen’s wife if she liked the “Bettie,” and she said she expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>every day to hear some minister preach about Johnnie the
Baptist and Minnie Magdelen, but she is cold and practical;
but I will read it. (<i>The twins cry and she says</i>): Oh poor little

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> May I ask you, deah man, if the twin has got oveh
swallowing the thimble? I heard it swallowed the hired girl’s
thimble the very day she hired out to another place, and left
you alone.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ed.</span> It did, and I wish it had swallowed the hired girl! I
feel reckless, and bad.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh! deah man; you need to be soothed. Poetry is
soothing, and comforting, when rehearsed by a tendeh female
voice. I have a few lines here, composed “On a Twin Swallowing
a Side Thimble.” It is more on a mournful plan; but I
will read it to you.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> If there is any object on earth, Josiah Allen’s wife, that
I warm to, it is the sweet little children of widowers. I have
always felt that I wanted to comfort them, and their deah pa’s.
I have always felt that it was women’s highest speah, her only
mission, to soothe, to cling, to smile, to coo. I always felt that it
was women’s greatest privilege, her crowning blessing to soothe
lacerations, to be a sort of a poultice to the manly breast when
it is torn with the cares of life. Do you not think so?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Am I a poultice, Betsey Bobbett? Do I look like one?
Am I in a condition to be one? I have done a big ironing to-day,
churned ten pounds of butter, scalded two hens and picked
’em, made seven pies and a batch of nut-cakes, two pans of
cookies, and mopped all over. And now I have got these
twins on my hands, all this carpet yarn to double, blank verses,
ahead on me, and dinner to get, and now I am called on to be
a poultice. What has my sect done that they have got to be
lacerator-soothers and poultices, when they have got everything
else under the sun to do. Everybody says that men are
stronger than wimmen, and why should they be treated like
glass-china, liable to break to pieces every minute? And if
they have got to be soothed, why can’t they git some man to
soothe ’em? They have as much agin time as wimmen have.
Evenin’s they don’t have anything else to do, they might jest
as well be a soothin’ each other as to be a hangin’ round grocery
stores, or settin’ by the fire whittlin’.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh! it must be so sweet, so strangely sweet, to soothe
the manly breast: to soothe, to smile, to coo.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I am perfectly willing to coo if I had time; and I had
jest as lives soothe lacerations as not, if I hadn’t everything
else under the sun to do. I had jest as lives sit down and
smile at Josiah Allen by the hour, and smooth down his bald
head affectionately, but who would fry the nut-cakes, and make
the ginger cookies. I could coo at him day in, and day out,
but who would skim milk, and wash pans, and darn, and fry,
and bake, and bile, while I was a cooin’?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh! Josiah Allen’s wife; we shall always diffeh on
the subject of coos. But I wish to crave your advice on a deep
and solemn subject. Martin Farquieh Tuppeh is one of the
sweetest poets of the ages. My sentiments have always blended
in with his sentiments. I have always flew with his flights,
and soared with his soars. And last night after I had retired,
one of his sublime ideahs come to me with a power I neveh
felt before. It knocked the bolted door of my heart open, and
said: “Betsey Bobbett, you have not neveh done it.” He remarks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>that if anybody is going to be married, their deah future companion
is on earth, though we may neveh have seen him, or
her, and it is our duty to pray for that future companion.
Josiah Allen’s wife, I have not neveh done it; I feel condemned.
Would you begin to pray now?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Are you going to pray for a husband, or about one?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> (<i>mournfully</i>) A little of both.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, I don’t know as it would no any hurt, Betsey.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I will begin to pray to-night, but that is not all. Folks
must work as well as pray; I am going to take a decided stand.
Be you a going to the quire meeting to-morrow night?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I am layin’ out to go if I hain’t too lame.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Josiah Allen’s wife will you stand by me? There is
not another female woman in Jonesville that I have the firm
unwaverin’ confidence in that I have in you. You always
bring about whatever you set your hands to, and I want to
know will you stand by me to-morrow night?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> What undertakin’ have you got into your head now,
Betsey Bobbett?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I am going to encourage the editor of the <i>Augur</i>. That
man needs a companion. Men are offish and bashful and do
not always know what is best for them. I have seen horses
hang back in the harness before now; I have seen geese that
would not walk up to be picked; I have seen children hang
back from pikery. The horses ought to be <i>made</i> to go; the
geese ought to be held and picked; the children ought to take
the pikery if you have to hold their noses to make them. The
editor of the <i>Augur needs</i> a companion, and I am going to encourage
that man to-morrow night, and I want to know Josiah
Allen’s wife, if you will stand by me?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> You know, Betsey, that I can’t run; I’m too fat and
lame; and then I’m gettin’ too old. Mebby I might <i>walk</i> up
and help you corner him, but you know I can’t run for anybody.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Why I thought he was coming back to take dinner,

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Wall, he was unhitchin’ his horse, and I happened to mention
that I guessed Betsey would be here to dinner too; and
he jumped into that buggy agin’ like lightnin’, and hollered
out:  “Fetch out the twins!” He acted sort o’ crazy like, and
skairt.</p>

good dinner, and I knew what it was to be a widower and live
on pancakes. But all he said was to yell out, “Fetch out the
twins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>Samantha goes to putting on the children’s wraps</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh, do not be in such haste, Josiah Allen’s wife. The

stay too. (<i>Betsey fixes her hair, arranges her neck-tie and looks anxiously

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Scene.</span>—<i>Outside of cottage—Josiah and Samantha within.—Cats
heard fighting dreadfully behind the scenes—Upper window opens,
and Thomas J. throws out something to scare cats.—When Josiah realizes
that it is a serenador, he gets out of bed and starts for the door—Samantha
pulling him back again—You can see their head and
shoulders as they pass by an open window below—Samantha with nightgown
and night-cap on; Josiah in similar raiment, only with a tall hat
and umbrella—They pass by the window several times, as he is determined
he will go out and stop the music, and she will not let him.—During
the serenade Tirzah Ann appears at an upper window opposite Thomas
Jefferson with a night-cap on, and a bouquet of flowers—She vainly
endeavors to attract Shakespeare’s attention.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Thos. J.</span> You’ve preached long enough, brothers, on that
text; I’ll put in a 7thly for you. (<i>Throws boot.</i>) You’ve protracted
your meeting here long enough; you may adjourn, now, to
somebody else’s window, and exhort them a spell. (<i>Throws
something more.</i>) Now I wonder if you’ll come round on this
circuit right away.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Thomas Jefferson, stop that noise.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Do let him be; do let him kill the old creeters, I am
wore out.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Josiah, I don’t mind his killin’ the cats, but I won’t
have him talking about holding protracted meetin’s and
preechin’; I won’t have it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Wall, do lay down; the most I care for is to get rid of
the cats.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> You do have wicked streaks Josiah, and the way you
let that boy go on is awful. Where do you think you will go
to, Josiah Allen?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> I shall go into another bed if you can’t stop talkin’. I
have been kept awake till midnight by them awful creeters, and
now you want to finish me. Oh, dummit! them dum cats are
at it agin.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Well, you needn’t swear so if they be; but I say it
hain’t cats.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> It is.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I know better, it hain’t cats.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Wall, if it hain’t cats, what is it?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> It is a acordeun.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> How come a acordeun under our window?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> It is Shakespeare Bobbett seranadin’ Tirzah Ann, and
he has got under the wrong window. Josiah Allen come back
here this minute; do you realize your condition; you hain’t
dressed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Wall, I can put my hat on I ’spose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Yes, a stovepipe hat is a great protection. Josiah
Allen if you go to the door in that condition, I’ll prosicute you.
What do you mean by acting so. You was young once yourself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> I wasn’t a confounded fool, if I was young.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Come back to bed, Josiah Allen; do you want to get
the Bobbetses and the Doodleses mad at you?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Yes, I do.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I should think you would be ashamed of yourself,
swearin’ and actin’ as you have; and you’ll end by gettin’ your
death cold. (<i>Shakespeare Bobbett has appeared outside with a guitar,
and played a strain, as if uncertain of the key. Think, oh, think
of me.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> No danger of our not thinkin’ on you, no danger on it.

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> What of her, Simon Slimpsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> She’ll be the death on me, and my soul is jeopardized
on account of her. To think that I, a member of a authordox
church, and the father of thirteen small children, could
be tempted to swear. But I did, not more’n two minutes ago.
I said, By Jupiter! I can’t stand it so much longer. And
last night to meetin’, when she was payin’ attention to me, I
wished I was a ghost; for I thought if I was a apperition I
could vanish from her view. Oh! I have got so low as to wish
I was a ghost. She come a rushin’ out of Deacon Gowdy’s
just now as I came past jest a purpose to talk to me. She
don’t give me no peace. Last night she would walk tight to
my side all the way from meetin’ and she looked so hungry at
the gate, as I went through and fastened it on the inside.</p>

that victim. And Betsey Bobbett will get round me yet, you
see if she don’t.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Cheer up, Simon Slimpsey; folks hain’t obleeged to

lookin’ so gloomy and deprested.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> It is the awful determination of them lines that apauls
me. I have seen it in another. Betsey Bobbett reminds me
dreadfully of another; she makes me think of that first wife of
mine. And I don’t want to marry again Miss Allen, I don’t
want to. I didn’t want to marry the first time, I wanted to be
a bachelder. I think they have the easiest time of it by half.
Now there is a friend of mine that is only half an hour younger
than I be, and that hadn’t ought to make much difference in our
looks, had it?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> No, Simon Slimpsey, it hadn’t.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> Well; you ought to see what a head of hair he’s got
now; sound to the roots, not a lock missing. I wanted to be
one, but my late wife come and kept house for me, and—and
married me. I lived with her for eighteen years, and when
she left me I was—I was reconciled. I was reconciled some
time before it took place. I don’t want to say nothin’ against
nobody that hain’t round here in this world, but I lost a good
deal of hair by my late wife; and I wanted to keep a lock or
two for my children to keep as a relict of me. I have got thirteen,
as you know, countin’ each pair of twins as two, and it
would take a considerable number of hairs to go round. I
don’t want to marry agin.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Mebby you are borrowin’ trouble without cause, Simon
Slimpsey, with life there is hope. Don’t give up so Simon
Slimpsey; mebby she’ll marry the editor of the <i>Augur</i>; she’s
payin’ lots of attention to him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> No, he won’t have her, she’ll get round me yet—you
mark my words, and when the time comes you will think of
what I told you. (<i>Simon weeps</i>) You see if she don’t get round
me yet.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Chirk up, Simon Slimpsey, be a man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> That is the trouble, if I wasn’t a man she would

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Eld. P.</span> Widder, I want to speak with you. (<i>She goes back and
they sit down on one of the benches.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Eld. P.</span> I hain’t seen you but once before since I was a widower.
It was a awful blow to me; a hard blow. (<i>Smiting his
breast.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> I feel to sympathize with you; I know how I felt
when I lost Doodle.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Yes; I tell you Widder. I have seen trouble lately.
A spell ago I lost the best cow I had; then I lost a new umbrella,
and a whale-bone whip, and now my wife is dead. I
tell you it cuts me right down; it makes me feel poor. You
wasn’t acquainted with the corpse, I believe.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> No, but I have heard her well spoke of.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Yes, she was a lovely woman. My heartstrings
was wrapped completely around her. Not a pair of pantaloons
have I hired made sense we was both married to each
other, nor a vest. I tell you it was hard to lose her, dretful
hard. I never realized how much I loved that woman till I
see I must give her up, and hire a girl at 2 dollars a week—and
they waste more than their necks are worth. I tell you my
heart is full of tender memories of that woman, when I
think how she would get up and build fires in the winter—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> That is what I always did for my Doodle. He
would be a dreamin’ how pretty I was, and how much he
loved me, and he’d want to go to sleep agin and dream it over.
So I would get up and split the kindlin’ wood and build the
fire, and get breakfast, so’s to let him lay and dream about me.
I love to build fires.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Do you love to build fires, Widder? I wish you
had been acquainted with the corpse; I believe you would
have loved each other like sisters.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> You must chirk up Elder Peedick, you must look
forward to happier days.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> I know there is another spear and I try to hang my
hopes up on it, a spear where hired girls are unknown and
partings are no more.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> I can’t bear hired girls.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> You look like the corpse; you <i>do</i> look like her, I
see it plainer and plainer. And oh, what a woman that was,
she knew her place so well; she always said wimmen wasn’t
equal to men. You couldn’t have hired her to have had rights.
She always said wimmin was too delicate and feeble to have
rights; she said that she had rather dig potatoes any day
than to have ’em. She could dig potatoes as fast as a man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> I knew I wasn’t the equal of Doodle. He used to
set in the rock’n’ chair while I would be ho’ng out the garden,
or bringin’ in wood, or churnin’ and read such beautiful arguments
to me, and so convincin’, provin’ it all out how havin’
rights would be too much for the weaker sect, and that men
wouldn’t feel nigh so tender and reverential towards ’em as they
did now.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Then you used to hoe out the garden and bring in
wood?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Yes, I loved to; I loved to dearly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Widder, I am a man of business. My wife has
been dead three weeks, and she won’t be no deader if I should
wait three months as some men do. I heard you a praisin’ up
my wagon and span of mares to-night, and if you’ll be my
bride, the wagon is yours and the mares. Widder, I throw
myself onto your feet, and I throw the wagon and the mares
onto ’em, and with them and me. I throw eighty-five acres of
good land, 14 cows, 5 calves, 4 three-year-olds, and a yearlin’, a
dwellin’ house, a good horse barn and myself. I throw ’em
all onto your feet, and there we lay on ’em.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Oh, Doodle! Doodle! if you was alive you would tell
your widder what to do to do right.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Widder, I am a layin’ on your feet, and my
property, my land, my live stock, my housen and my housen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>stuff, are all a layn’ on ’em. Make up your mind at once, for
if you don’t consent, I have got other views ahead of me which
must be seen to at once. Time is hastenin’ and the world is
full of willin’ wimmen. Widder what do you say?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> Wall, I have got kinder out the habit of marryin’, it
comes kinder natural to me, and your linement looks a good
deal like Doodle’s linement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peedick.</span> Then you consent, widder. Wall we will be married
a week from Sunday; we will be married Sunday so’s not
to break into the week’s work. And I will turn off my hired
girl, and you can come right to my house and do the housework,
and help me what you can out doors, and tend to the
milk of 14 cows and be perfectly happy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Scene.</span>—<i>Betsey and Simon Slimpsey at home.—Eight or nine children
in various stages of distress, faces tied up, etc.—Two cradles with
children in them.—Betsey sewing.—Simon trying to take care of the
children.</i></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Josiah Allen</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Good mornin’, Simon; good mornin’, Betsey.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> (<i>Haughtily.</i>) Excuse my not getting up and setting you
a chair, Josiah Allen. Being married, I don’t have to be so
particular in my manners as I used to. Thank heavens! I can
hold my head up now as high as anybody.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> We heard you was all sick up here, and I thought I
would come in and see how you was.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Are you not all coming to the reception to-night?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Yes, I ’spose so; and Samantha told me if there was
anything she could do for the children, she would come earlier.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> I wish she would come and see if something can’t be
done for ’em. They have all got the mumps and measles, and
colic, and everything. And she’s to work all the time on her
ridin’ dress, and fixin for this doin’s of her’n. I tried to have
her put it off till five or six of the children got better; but she
won’t.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> No; I told my husband, Mr. Slimpsey, that my dignity
as a married woman was at stake. In common times it is well
to attend to sickness, but now, dignity and style both demand
that I receive to-night.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jos.</span> Wall; Samantha will come right over.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Tell her Mrs. Simon Slimpsey will be glad to see her;
formally Bobbett. (<i>Exit Josiah, and soon Samantha comes in followed by
Miss Gowdy and Mrs. Elder Peedick.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> How do you do, Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> (<i>Coldly, holding out her hand, but not rising.</i>) I am glad you
come early, Sophronia. I want you to feel free with me, just as
if I was not married. I shall still associate with my old
friends. I don’t mean to show out no more haughtiness than
I can help. I have told my husband, Mr. Slimpsey, that I
should not turn my back on all single women now, if I was
rose above ’em in station. Help yourself to some chairs. (<i>They
sit down and Samantha and Mrs. Peedick each of them take up a child
on their laps.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> How are the children now?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> The seventh boy is worse, and the twin girls are
took down with it. It would be a melancholy pleasure if you
could do something for ’em.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Have they been sweat?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> No; I told my husband, Mr. Slimpsey, that I would
not sweat them until after our reception. Sweating children
is more or less depressing in its effects, and I felt that I
needed all my youthful spirits and energies to support the
weight of dignity that will enwrap me on this occasion like a
mantilly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Peedick.</span> I sweat Doodle when he had the very oh lord,
till the sweat run right off his linement, and blistered both his
feet till he couldn’t stand up on em; and I shall probably try
to make Elder Peedick jest as comfortable when he is sick.
But, oh Doodle, Doodle; your relict never can forget you,
never.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Chirk up Mrs. Peedick; don’t try to be a widder and
a wife at the same time. Don’t try to be a mourner for one man
and a bride to another man simultanius. It is jest as onresonable
as it would be to try to set down and stand up at once.
Betsey, have you give ’em any smart weed?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> No; If my husband, Mr. Slimpsey, approves, I shall
probably sleep up some after the reception, and after I complete
this riding-dress. I have had to write a poem to read
upon this occasion. ‘A Him of victory,’ and it has hindered
me about my dress. I <i>need</i> it, for I shall want, to ride out and
take the air as soon as the children get well, for even married
people cannot breathe without air, and I want to finish this
for my first appearance on horseback after marriage. I have
nothing to wear suitable for a bride, and this pale-plue cambric
trimmed with otter color, will be becomin’ to me, and very
dressy. I knew a good deal would be expected of me in my
changed circumstances. I shall probably attract a great deal
of attention.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> I should think you would, ridin’ that old horse of
your’n. His ribs look like wash-boards.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I should jest as lives ride a case-knife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> Most dead with blind staggers and lame as he can
be, a stumblin’ and a fallin’ all the time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I got something now to sustain me and hold me up, if
horses do fall under me. They may lame me, but I have got a
dignity, now, Sophronia, that horses cannot give neither can
they take away. I’m married now. (<i>Simon groans.</i>) I shall
also appear at conference meeting next Sunday evening for the
first time after marriage. There is one thing I feel as if I must
say in public at once, and that is, that I believe in the perseverence
of saints.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> <i>Saints!</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I will now go and make a few changes in my toilet for
the occasion. (<i>She goes out carrying her riding-dress</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> I havn’t seen you before, Simon, since your marriage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> I knew it would come to this, Miss Allen; I told
you how it would be. She always said it was her spear to
marry, and I knew I should be the one; I always was the one.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Does she use you well, Simon?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> She’s pretty hard on me. I hain’t had my way in
anything sense the day she married me. She began to hold
my nose to the grindstone, as the sayin’ is, before we had
been married two hours; and she hain’t no house-heeper, or
cook. I have had to live on pancakes ’most of the time since
it took place, and they’re tougher than leather. I have been
’most tempted to cut some out of my boot-leg, to see if they
wouldn’t be tenderer; but I never should hear the last of it if
I did. She jaws me awfully, and orders me ’round as if I was
a dog. If I was a yeller dog she couldn’t seem to look down
on me more, and treat me any worse.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall; I always did mistrust them wimmen that don’t
want any rights, only to cling and coo. But I don’t want to
run anybody to their back. She thought it was her spear to
marry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> I told you that spear of her’n would destroy me, and
it has. (<i>He weeps</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>Enter Betsey, with several pairs of ragged pantaloons to mend over
her arm, and several sheets of foolscap paper in her hand.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I thought perhaps I could get a few minutes to sew before
the arrival of our guests. I have 7 pairs of pantaloons to
mend before I retiah. Children wear out clothing so rapidly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and our children seem to make a specialty of ripping and tearing.
We have been obleeged to put two of them to bed on
that account, and they are swearing now violently in bed, at
their step motheh, because I have not been able to mend their
clothes in time for the reception.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Are you happy, Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I am at rest; more at rest than I have been for years!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> (<i>Looking round at the sick children and taking up the ragged
pantaloons and looking at them</i>:) At <i>rest</i>!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Are you happy, Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I feel awful dignified. There is not any use in a
woman’s trying to feel dignified until she is married. I have
tried it and I know. I can truly say, Josiah Allen’s wife, that
I never knew what dignity was until one week ago last Sunday
night, at half-past 7 in the evening.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Are you happy, Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I have got somthing to lean on.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Don’t lean too hard, Betsey.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Why?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> You may be sorry if you do. Do you love your husband,
Betsey?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> I don’t think love is necessary. I am married, and that
is enough to satisfy any woman who is more or less reasonable—<i>that</i>
is the main and important thing; as I have said, love and
respect are miners.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> <i>Miners!</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> My Doodle never called it a miner; and he worshiped
the ground I walked on, and the neighbors all said he
did; they said he loved the ground better than he did me,
but he didn’t, he worshiped us both.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> <i>Miners</i>, Betsey Bobbett.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Mrs. Betsey Bobbett Slimpsey.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Wall, Mrs. Betsey Slimpsey, there hain’t no more beautiful
sight on earth than to see two human souls out of pure
love to each other gently approaching each other as if they
must; and, at last, all their hopes and thoughts and affections
running together like two drops of water in a morning glory
blow, and to see them nestling there, not caring for nobody
outside the blow, bound up in each other till the sun evaporates
’em as it were, and draws ’em together up into the heavens,
not separating ’em even up there. Why such a marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>as that is a sight that does men and angels good to look at.
But when a woman sells herself, swops her purity, her self-respect,
her truth and her soul, for any kind of barter, such as
a home, a few thousand dollars, the name of being married, a
horse and buggy, some jewelry, etc.; and not only sells herself,
but worse than the Turk wimmen, goes ’round herself hunting
up a buyer: crazy, wild-eyed, afraid she won’t find none. Suppose
she does have a minister for a salesman—my contempt for
such a female is inmitigable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Miss G.</span> And so is mine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wid. D.</span> And so would my Doodleses have been; you could
see that by his linement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> And I don’t want to hear such wimmen talk about infamy.
For in what respect are they better than these other infamous
wimmen we all despise? Do you ’spose their standin’ up in
front of a minister and tellin’ a few lies, such as I promise to
love a man I hate, and honor a man I despise, and obey a man
I calculate to make toe the mark? Do you ’spose these few lies
make ’em any purer in the sight of God? Marriage is like baptism,
as I have said mor’n a hundred times. You have got to
have the inward grace and the outward form to make it lawful
and right. What good does the water do if your soul hain’t
baptized with the love of God? It hain’t no better than fallin’
into the creek.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Some of us married folks feel differently, Josiah Allen’s
wife. Let me read to you a short poem of 20 or 30 verses written
recently by a married woman, by she that was formerly
Betsey Bobbett, now Mrs. Simon Slimpsey. I am to read it
to the reception to-night, but I think it will be well for me to
read it over so I can deliver it more eloquently. Hear my
Bridal Owed, hear my Him of Victory.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> How can I be calm and hear it? Oh, John Rogers!
and Foxes Martyrs! how I sympathize with you.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> Oh, Doodle! Doodle! what shall I do to do right?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> (<i>In a low tone</i>) Nine children, and one at the breast!
Thumb screws and grid-irons! (<i>Speaking in her usual tone.</i>) No,
I will not ontie myself from this stake of martyrdom. I will
cling to duty’s apron strings. Simon, if I was in your place, I
should sweat the five biggest boys to-night, and most of the

white lawn even checks. I wanted to look sort of bridy, and
still I wanted to mourn a little at the same time. The white
checks means Elder Peedick, the black checks stands for Doodle.
For oh, what a man that was.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sam.</span> Miss Peedick if you don’t take my advice, you’ll see
trouble ahead on you. When a widder man or a widder
woman, embarks on a new voyage, let ’em burn the ship behind
’em that they sailed round in, in their former voyages. This
trying to be a pardner and a mourner at one time is gaulin’ to
man or woman. Mournin’ for Doodle was jest as honorable as
anything could be; marryin’ Elder Peedick was another honorable
job, and you ort to made up your mind which business
would be the most happyfyin’ and proftable to you, and then
foller it up with a willin’ mind, but don’t try to do both.
Betsey, we will be here in good season. I have got a nice presant
for you, but bein’ pretty hefty, I shan’t probably bring it
to-night. It’s a piller case full of dried apples and a jar of butter.
Josiah will bring a sack of flour.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> Why can’t you stand up there alone and lemme be.
I wish you would. I wanted you to go off on a weddin’ tower;
you was crazy for one and I told you to go, and I’d stay to
home and tend to things, and the longer you stayed the better
I’d like it. But no, you wouldn’t go unless I went, and now you
want to make me stand up there by you half the night, when
you know it is all I can do to get up onto my feet any way.
You don’t seem to have no mercy on me at all, orderin’ me
round all the time.</p>

we be. (<i>Editor of Augur and bride come last.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ed.</span> Accept my hearty congratulations. I can truly say that
I never felt more heartfelt happiness and relief than on this
occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> Well you may feel happy; well you may.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ed.</span> I am not a natural singer, in fact, my efforts in that direction
have always been of such a nature as to cause sadness
to my best friends; but on this occasion I feel like bursting
forth into song. And we will now with the permission of Mr.
and Mrs. Slimpsey, greet them with a bridal song.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bet.</span> Oh, yes; sing to us some rejoicing anthem, or some
sweet, and tendeh love song.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> Can’t you sing China?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ed.</span> Why, that is a funeral hymn, Mr. Slimpsey.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Simon.</span> I know it has been used as such, but it seems as if it
would be a sort of a melancholy pleasure to me to hear it now.
But I hain’t peticular; sing anything—sing, if you feel like it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> They sung China to Doodleses funeral.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Eld. P.</span> (<i>Looking very angry</i>) Doodleses name hain’t no name
to be used on this occasion, Miss Peedick. I wish to gracious
that I could get five minutes rest from Doodle.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> Wall he had a beautiful linement on him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Eld. P.</span> (<i>very cross</i>) What if he had?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> But you have got a beautiful linement, too. You
are what would be called very handsome.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Eld. P.</span> (<i>sweetly</i>) You are a sensible woman, Miss Peedick.
You are a lovely woman. Every day of your life you make
me think more and more of the corpse. But I suppose they
are waiting for me to pitch the tune. Being leader of the
quire they naturally lean on me for harmony. So we will now
sing the bridal song, kindly arranged for this happy occasion
by the Editor of the <i>Augur</i>. (<i>They all sing to the tune of the jubilee
song, “Mary and Martha’s just gone along.”)</i></p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
